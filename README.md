redirt : tidal + renoise = <3

The idea here is to control renoise instead of superdirt as a sound synthesis engine.

To use redirt:

- `t1 ... t8` instead of `d1 ... dN` to select on which track to play
- `sound` selects instrument number `x`
- `note` sends notes to renoise
- you can use `|+ octave x` to transpose notes to a given octave
- `gain` controls velocity
- `m1 ... m8` controls the macros of the selected instrument. Build some crazy instrument, map 8 macros and voilÃ ! you can control them from tidal

As for effects, you can access them with the following:

- `device` or `dev` selects the device in the device chain of a given track
- `param` selects a parameter by its name
- `value` sets the value of the parameter

# Beware of the note_off

I think tidal and renoise were designed with a different idea in mind. In tidal, when a message is sent to play a note, the note's length is passed along with `delta` (length of a step) and friends. So superdirt knows from the begining when the sound should stop. I didn't check superdirt's implementation, but I guess a synth is spawned for each played note, and killed when the note ends.

But renoise is designed closer to the MIDI approach, namely NOTE_ON and NOTE_OFF events are separate. So NOTE_ON starts the sound, and when you want to stop it you send a NOTE_OFF on the same channel, same note.

This difference make it quite painful to manage note_off. Right now, I'm cheating by setting my drumkits to one-shots, and my synths to monophonic, NNA parameter to note-off and a bit of release.

How the issue should be addressed?

- should the musician program its note_off events in the sequence?
- should tidal generate the note_off events behind the scene?

I don't know, really. If you have an idea, let me know!
